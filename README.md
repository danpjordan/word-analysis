# word-analysis
A word analysis software for a specific format of text.

This program is for a very specific use case, but can be modified for other uses.
In short, I have a journal that I write in most days and I wanted to analyze the text
To do this most effectivly I made a program to sort create graphs and data point depending
on a variety of conditions. I have added into this repository an example joural so the program
can be simluated. I have alot attached the output of the simulated program.
